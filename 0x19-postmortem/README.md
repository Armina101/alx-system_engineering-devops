**Postmortem Report**

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Our little adventure unfolded on January 15, 2024, from 10:00 to 12:30 WAT. If it were a movie, we'd call it "The Database Connection Leak Strikes Back."

Impact:
Imagine trying to upload cat pictures and getting stuck in a black hole. That's what happened to 15% of our users during this cosmic disturbance. They were left in the dark, wondering if their furry friends had broken the internet.

Root Cause:
Our Sherlock Holmes investigation revealed a sneaky database connection leak partying hard, causing a resource hangover for our image processing service. Talk about a database drama queen!

Timeline:

- Detection Time:
  - At 10:00 WAT, our monitoring alarm went off like an angry rooster on a Monday morning, alerting us to a spike in database connection errors. Rise and shine!

- Issue Identification:
  - We dived into the image processing service logs, and it was like reading a mystery novel. The plot twist? An unexpected flood of database connections stealing the spotlight.

- Misleading Paths:
  - Cue the suspenseful music. We investigated the usual suspects—database servers—but found nothing. It was like searching for a needle in a haystack, in the dark, with sunglasses on.

- Escalation:
  - 03:45 WAT: Desperate times call for desperate measures. We called in the reinforcements—the database and application teams joined the party to figure out who invited the connection leak.

- Resolution:
  - By 04:45 WAT, we closed the leaked connections, fixed the image processing service's bad behavior, and rebooted it. Crisis averted; cat pictures resumed their rightful place in the digital realm.

Root Cause and Resolution:

- Cause:
  - Picture this: the image processing service was hosting an unauthorized connection leak rave. We kicked out the troublemakers, fixed the code, and installed bouncers to prevent gatecrashers.

- Resolution:
  - We performed a magical spell—okay, not really, just fixed the code, optimized connection handling, and added extra vigilance to our monitoring system. Voila! No more leaks, just smooth operations.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

- Improvements/Fixes:
  - Our code now has fewer secrets than a magician's hat. Regular code reviews and static analysis tools will be our trusty assistants in keeping it that way.
  - Enhanced monitoring is our new superhero, detecting anomalies faster than a superhero hears a distress signal.

- Tasks:
  - Over the next two weeks, we'll be on a quest—conducting reviews and vanquishing potential connection leaks from all corners of our kingdom.
  - Automated tests are our knights in shining armor, protecting the image processing service from future misadventures.
  - Training sessions for our developers are the Jedi training grounds, where they'll master the art of database connection handling.

In conclusion, our tale of the "Database Connection Leak Strikes Back" was an epic journey filled with twists, turns, and a dash of humor. We've patched up the leaks, reinforced our defenses, and are ready for the next chapter in our digital saga. May the code be with us!
